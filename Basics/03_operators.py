# Arithmetic Operators

a = 2
b = 5
c = a + b
print(c)

# Assignment Operators

a = 5
b = 4-2
c += 9 # increment the value of b by 9 ans assign it to be
# also means c = c + 9
print(c)
d = 7
d = d + 9 # c and d both are same
print(d)

c -= 6
print(c)

# Comparison Operators

# Comparison Operators always returns boolean value
x = 4
x = x <= 4
print(x)
x = 5==5
print(x)
x = 5!=5
print(x)

# Logical Operators

print("True or False is ",True or False)
print("False or True is ",False or True)
print("True or True is ",True or True)

print("/n")

print("True and False is ",True and False)
print("False and True is ",False and True)
print("True and True is ",True and True)
print("False and False is ",False and False)


# not operator
# it converts True into False and False into True
